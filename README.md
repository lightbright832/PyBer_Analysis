## Overview of the analysis:
### Purpose
The travel industry has witnessed exponential growth over the past few decades. Families and single travelers are finding the time to venture to their favorite destinations all over the world. PlanMyTrip understands how important it is to meet the growing needs of consumers. For this reason they want to analyze data that can be used to recommend hotels based on client's weather preferences. With this analysis marketing will be more streamlined with higher conversion rates than previously experienced. A looker is bound to become a guest when the recommendations cater to their unique preferences.

## Results: Ridesharing data
### Total Rides
The total rides image shoes a break down of the total rides that are taken in each city type. We can see that the number of rides is lower for rural areas than it is in more urban cities. This makes sense being that the populations are going to be smaller in rural cities. In suburban areas there is not much of a need for rideshare as these citizens more than likely have vehicles and do not have to commute as often.

### Total Drivers
The total number of drivers coincides with the population sizes of these cities. If there are not as many people there is not as much of a need to have drivers available. In larger cities there is more of a demand for drivers.
