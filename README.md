# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis:
### Purpose
Ridesharing is become the new way of the world. For those who may be out of town visiting or just without a vehicle there is a growing demand for transportation. In the past consumers relied on taxis and other modes of public transportation. Now there is the availability of drivers who work for companies like PyBer. This analysis is being conducted as a means of analyzing the business that comes out of different city types. The different city types of rural, suburban, and urban. The goal is to see which city type is bringing the most business so that future decisions can be made. 

## Results: Ridesharing data
### Total Rides
The total rides image shoes a break down of the total rides that are taken in each city type. We can see that the number of rides is lower for rural areas than it is in more urban cities. This makes sense being that the populations are going to be smaller in rural cities. In suburban areas there is not much of a need for rideshare as these citizens more than likely have vehicles and do not have to commute as often.

### Total Drivers
The total number of drivers coincides with the population sizes of these cities. If there are not as many people there is not as much of a need to have drivers available. In larger cities there is more of a demand for drivers.

### Total Fares
Just like the above statistics the more drivers and rides that are taking place the more fares will accumulate. If there are not many rides than the total fares will be lower.

### Average Fare Per Ride
This part of the analysis reveals that although rural areas do not see as many riders the average fares are higher. This is due in part to the length of each trip in these areas and the higher rate for rides. When drivers are not high in demand that means less drivers can receive higher fares. The average fare goes down from suburban cities to urban. This again is in part to shorter trips and more availability of drivers.

### Average Fare Per Driver
Drivers in rural cities make more money per ride based on this image. The higher rates means each driver is able to bring in larger sums of money. In urban areas the driver may get less per ride but they are completing more rides.

### Total Fare by City Type

## Summary:
The results of the analysis reveal that more money is being made in urban cities. There is a substantial amount of money being made in suburban cities but less than urban. In the rural areas there is not much revenue at all. Drivers are making more per ride but the rides are not occuring like they do in more urban cities. Moving forward PyBer can use this information to decide if it is worth it to continue operating in smaller more rural towns. Based on these results it would not be recommended.
